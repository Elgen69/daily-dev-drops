# 🧪 Polyglot Systems Lab

> A cross-language codebase exploring programming paradigms, systems logic, and architectural design patterns — across over 20 programming languages.

This repository serves as a structured experiment space for exploring **multi-paradigm programming concepts** using a wide variety of languages and ecosystems. It is designed to test, prototype, and benchmark patterns across procedural, object-oriented, functional, and declarative styles.

Each file or module is crafted to:
- Simulate real-world scenarios in its native ecosystem
- Highlight language-specific idioms, quirks, and best practices
- Provide cross-language contrast in design patterns and logic handling

## 🧠 Core Themes
- Language expressiveness & ergonomics
- Data structure design & memory handling
- CLI tools and rapid prototyping
- Systems-level vs. high-level abstractions
- Experimental patterns in edge cases
- Paradigm shifting (OO ↔ FP ↔ imperative)

## 🌐 Language Coverage
This lab includes implementation examples, logic processors, and feature-mimicking scripts in:

- Python, Java, C
- JavaScript, TypeScript
- C++, Rust, Go
- Swift, Kotlin, Objective-C
- Ruby, PHP, Perl
- Shell (Bash), SQL, HTML, CSS
- R, Lua, Haskell, Dart, Scala

## 📁 Folder Organization
Each file stands alone and highlights a unique concept, such as:
- DSL-style function composition
- AST-like data mutation and traversal
- Recursive functional utilities
- Minimal web server scaffolds
- Custom data structures (e.g., stacks, trees)
- Syntax-based performance comparisons

## 🛠️ Use Cases
- Quick reference for syntax differences and core features
- Ideation playground for larger polyglot systems
- Interview warm-up repository
- Benchmarking across languages

## 🔍 Example Highlights
- `server.go`: Lightweight HTTP server with routing logic
- `math.rs`: Pattern-matched recursion in Rust
- `notes.kt`: Functional list handling in Kotlin
- `todo.dart`: Reactive modeling in Dart
- `shapes.cpp`: Virtual inheritance and polymorphism
- `parse.pl`: File I/O in legacy scripting

## 📌 Philosophy
> This is not a tutorial repository — it's a **systems thinking lab** built through language exploration.

All samples are maintained to reflect idiomatic practices within each language. Some contain inline comparisons to other languages where useful.

> 💡 This project is continuously evolving as part of an ongoing exploration into software language theory, code ergonomics, and practical cross-compatibility design.
